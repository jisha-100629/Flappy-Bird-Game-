Flappy Bird Game â€“ Java Edition

=> Overview  
This project is a recreation of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed entirely using Java and the Swing framework. It is designed to demonstrate core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, event-driven interaction, and basic game development techniques. The game features gravity-based motion, randomized obstacles, and responsive user controls to provide a simple yet enjoyable user experience.

=> Key Features  
- Real-time bird movement influenced by gravity  
- Randomized pipe (branch) obstacle generation  
- Collision detection and scoring system  
- Keyboard controls using `KeyListener`  
- Smooth gameplay using Java `Timer`  
- Reset and replay functionality  

=> Technologies Used  
- Java (JDK 8 or above)  
- Java Swing for GUI  
- Event-driven programming concepts  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles  

=> How to Run  
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open the project in any Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  
3. Compile and run the main file (usually `FlappyBird.java`).  
4. Press the `SPACEBAR` to make the bird jump and avoid obstacles.  

=> Learning Objectives  
This project helps understand concepts like:  
- Real-time rendering and updates  
- Handling user input through keyboard events  
- Game loop control and timing  
- Application of object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism  

=> Possible Future Enhancements  
- Add sound effects and background music  
- Improve graphics using JavaFX or external assets  
- Introduce levels or difficulty scaling  
- Extend compatibility to Android using Java-based frameworks  
- Add a high score tracker and game menus  

=> Conclusion  
This Flappy Bird project is not only a great way to learn the essentials of game development using Java, but also a creative exercise that combines logic, graphics, and interactive programming in a simple and engaging way. It serves as a strong foundation for developers aiming to explore more advanced game engines or mobile game development in the future.
